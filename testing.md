[Verse 1]
C                         F        C
I've been waiting for the tides to change
    	F    	C        	G
For the waves to send you my way
C                     	F   C
I see you darling but you pixilate
    	F   	C       	G
It gets hard to take these days

[Pre-Chorus]
     	C          	F   C       	F
But we’ll hold the line, I won't let go
   	C              	G                        	C
'Cause I’ll be there when you can finally make it home
             	F
And I don't mind
   	C        	F
'Cause we both know
 	C               	G                       	G
That we'll be fine when you can finally make it home

[Chorus]
         	Am                	F                   	C	G
Because when I'm in a room with you that missing piece is found
          	Am                     	F
You know when you're by my side, darling
                  	C   G
Nothing can bring us down

[Verse 2]
C            	F  	C
I remember happy wastеd days
    	F  	C        	G
Summers golden haze in our еyes
C                 	F    	C
Lifting you above the breaking waves
     	F    	C       	G
Memories floating back to my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
    	C          	F   C       	F
You said hold the line, I won't let go
  	C              	G                        	C
Cause I’ll be there when you can finally make it home
             	F
And I don't mind
   	C        	F
'Cause we both know
 	C               	G                       	G
That we'll be fine when you can finally make it home

[Chorus]
         	Am                	F                   	C	G
Because when I'm in a room with you that missing piece is found
          	Am                     	F
You know when you're by my side, darling
                  	C   G
Nothing can bring us down
           	Am                 	F                	C   G
It's like when you're far away from me I get lost in the crowd
         	Am                	F                   	C	G
Because when I’m in a room with you that missing piece is found

[Bridge]
F                 	C         	G
I won't waste a minute when you're here
      	G                	F
And we're finally in the clear
          	C         	G
When every day is like the last
           	G
I just keeping holding fast

[Chorus]
         	Am                	F                   	C	G
Because when I'm in a room with you that missing piece is found
          	Am                     	F
You know when you're by my side, darling
                  	C   G
Nothing can bring us down
           	Am                 	F                	C   G
It's like when you're far away from me I get lost in the crowd
         	Am                	F                   	C	G
Because when I’m in a room with you that missing piece is found
